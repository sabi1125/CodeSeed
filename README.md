# CodeSeed
CodeSeed is a script that automates the creation of the folder structure of your backend API. It creates all the files and folders necessary so you can jump right in and start working on your backend project. Currently it only supports two languages (golang and typescript).

The name CodeSeed comes from the fact that this script helps you seed our backend API that will later grow to be your project.

Happy Hacking!!

## Installation

### Manually

### The Easy Way
The easiest way to use CodeSeed is to download OS specific binary from the latest release and add the path to the binary in your `rc` file or if you are on windows, add the path of the codeseed binary to the Environment variables.

### Linux && Darwin
To manually install codeseed you need to have python installed on your computer. Once you have confirmed that you have python installed, you can then clone the codeseed repository and run the `install.sh` file inside of it.
```
git clone https://github.com/sabi1125/CodeSeed.git
```
The `install.sh` script will create a `~/.codeseed` binary, you will have to export this path in your `rc` file like the following.

```
 export PATH="$HOME/.codeseed:$PATH" 
 ```

### Windows
Currently the `install.sh` only works with unix like systems for windows run `python3 -m PyInstaller --onefile codeseed.py` this will create a `dist` folder. Add the path to the `dist` folder to your Environment variables and restart your machine and you are good to go.

## Usage
Using CodeSeed is very easy. You just need to call codeseed on your terminal and add the name of the Backend project you want to create. Like the following.

```
codeseed init <project-name> --options
```
This will create a folder with a Backend project on your local machine. 

The options can be chained if the option do not require an argument like the following.

```
codeseed init <project-name> -dras
```

Options like `--language` and `--url` requires a string argument so they cannot be chained.
```
codeseed init --language golang --url git@github.com:sabi1125/CodeSeed.git
```
